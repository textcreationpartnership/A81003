            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SO ſoon as I came into theſe parts, I met with an earneſt deſire from the Committee of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take upon me the charge here, for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of the Gariſon of <hi>Pomfret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I received alſo commands from my Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>I have had the ſight of a Letter to the Houſe of Commons, wherein things are ſo repreſented, as if this ſiege were at ſuch a paſſe, that the prize were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gained: In conſideration whereof, I thought fit to let you know what the true ſtate of this Garriſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117307:3"/>is, as alſo the condition of the Country, that ſo you may not think my deſire for ſuch things as would be neceſſary to carry on this work, unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
               <lb/> The Caſtle hath been victualled with two hundred and twenty or forty fat Cattle, within theſe three weeks, and they have alſo gotten in (as I am credibly informed) Salt enough for them and more. So that I apprehend, they are Victualled for a twelve month: The men within are reſolved to endure, to the utmoſt extremity, expecting no mercy, as indeed they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve none.</p>
            <p>The place is very well known to be one of the ſtrongeſt inland Gariſons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, well watered, ſituated upon a rock in every part of it, and therfore difficult to Mine The walls very thick and high, with ſtrong Towers, and if battered, very difficult of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, by reaſon of the depth and ſteepneſſe of the Graft. The Country is exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, not able to bear free quarter, nor well able to furniſh proviſions, if wee had moneys. The work is like to be long, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials be not furniſhed anſwerable. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it my duty, to repreſent unto you as followeth, Viz.
<list>
                  <item>1 That monies be provided for three
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117307:4"/>compleat Regiments of Foot, and two of Horſe.</item>
                  <item>2 That Money bee provided for all contingencies, which are in view too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to innumerate.</item>
                  <item>3 That five hundred barrels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſix good battering Guns, with three hundred ſhot to each Gun, bee ſpeedily ſent down to <hi>Hull.</hi>

            <p>And for ought I know, it may coſt you one more, if it be trifled withall, beſides the diſhonour of it, and what other danger may be immergent, by its being in ſuch hands.</p>
            <p>It is true, here are ſome two or three great Guns in <hi>Hull,</hi> and hereabouts, but they are unſerviceable: And your Gariſons in <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> are very much unſupplyed at this time.</p>
            <p>I have not as yet drawn any of our Foot to this place, only I make uſe of Col. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and Col. <hi>Maleveries</hi> Foot Regiments, and keep the reſt of the Guards with the Horſe, purpoſing to bring on ſome of our Foot to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
